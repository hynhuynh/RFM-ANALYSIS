### **MARKETING STRATEGY SUGGESTION**
#### Early Life
**Profile:** 
+ Customers in this segment have made recent purchases, but they havent built a strong shopping routine yet.
+ They buy occasionally and spend at a lower level, which means there is still **a lot of room to grow and strengthen the relationship.**

**Marketing Strategy:**

**Objective:** Help customers build a consistent shopping habit by encouraging more frequent purchases in the early stage.

- Double Day campaigns (e.g., 9.9, 10.10, 11.11) with attractive vouchers to make shopping feel exciting and rewarding.
- Run Payday promotions around salary periods to match customers's higher purchasing power.
- Provide reward for 1st-to-2nd and 2nd-to-3rd purchases to gently guide them toward repeat buying.
- Introduce daily check-in rewards (points, small vouchers, loyalty credits) to increase daily engagement.
- Create simple weekly missions (e.g. complete 2 purchases to unlock a bonus reward).
- Offer milestone rewards at the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th orders to celebrate progress and reinforce habit formation.

**Objective:** Maintain engagement and strengthen loyalty among these high-value users.
- Develop loyalty tiers or VIP programs to reward consistent engagement.

#### Prevent Churn
**Profile:**  
+ Customers in this segment used to purchase more actively but have recently slowed down.
+ They still show meaningful spending behavior, but the longer gap between purchases suggests their engagement may be fading.

**Marketing Strategy:**

**Objective:** Re-engage and prevent customers from slipping into full inactivity.
- Use personalized push notifications or emails to bring them back
- Offer personalized comeback vouchers.
- Run re-engagement campaigns during Double Day or seasonal events.
- Provide tailored product recommendations based on their previous purchases.
- Launch short-term 'return missions' (e.g. complete 1 purchase this week to unlock bonus rewards).

#### Churn

**Profile:** 
+ Customers in this segment have not made a purchase for a long period and show very low purchasing intensity.

+ *With an average total order of around 1*, many are likely one-time buyers who never developed a consistent shopping habit. As a result, their probability of returning is relatively low, indicating a high churn risk.

**Marketing Strategy:**

**Objective:** Reactivate selectively while maintaining marketing efficiency and cost control.
- Launch win-back campaigns with an attractive discount (but control cost)
- Use personalized push notifications or emails to bring them back
- Reintroduce best-selling or trending products with limited-time comeback offers.
